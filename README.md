# Express-Backend-Template
Simple Api for quick spinnup of projects.

It features: 
- Simple Login and SignUp Authentication
- Mongo Connection
- Template For Mongoose buildout
- Simple middleware

Need two specific values in a .env file:
- MONGO_URI
- TOKEN_KEY

After that should spin up no issues, and can obviously be extended into any which way you want to go. Cheers!
